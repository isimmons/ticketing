# Ticket Sales Microservices Project

This is the project from Stephen Griders "Microservices with NodeJS and React" course on Udemy.
I have made some changes so it is not identical to Stephens code. Mostly I might have used some different variable names or turned some code into one liners here and there. I also fixed anything that didn't work due to new lib/package versions. The course is getting a bit old but still awesome and packed full of excellent information.
