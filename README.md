# Ticket Sales Microservices Project

This is the project from Stephen Griders "Microservices with NodeJS and React" course on Udemy.
I have made some changes so it is not identical to Stephens code. Mostly I might have used some different variable names or turned some code into one liners here and there. I also fixed anything that didn't work due to new lib/package versions. The course is getting a bit old but still awesome and packed full of excellent information.

I have changed the auth services mongo deployment into a StatefulSet kind with persistent storage but not any of the other ones yet. Thought I'd mention it since its kindof a major change.

I fully intend on making a ton of updates as I took notes and did a lot of research while taking this course. I'll also be adding in some professional grade documentation.

Hell I might even delete this repo and wait until it looks a lot better before putting it back up.

IDK :-)
